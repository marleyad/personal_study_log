As of **February 28, 2025**:     
- **503 study days logged**     
- **Over 1,800 hours studied**       
- **6,000+ Anki cards reviewed**    
  
This log has been a cornerstone of my learning journey, which began with coding and has since evolved into pursuing a **Master's in Data Science**. It has kept me motivated, organized, and accountable. 

I’m passionate about lifelong learning and committed to improving my skills.
