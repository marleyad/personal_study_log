# Study Log Repository

Welcome to my **Study Log Repository**, where I track my learning journey and growth over time. This repository includes a PDF printout of the Excel sheet I use to log my study sessions and progress.
  
## Overview     
      
As of **November 22, 2024**:
- **426 study days logged**   
- **Over 1,500 hours studied**      
- **5,800+ Anki cards reviewed**  
  
This log has been a cornerstone of my learning journey, which began with coding and has since evolved into pursuing a **Master's in Data Science**. It has kept me motivated, organized, and accountable. 

I’m passionate about lifelong learning and committed to improving my skills. I know reaching mastery will take many more years, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and the systems I’ve built to support my goals.

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Days**      | A sequential count of study days, starting from 1.                                              |
| **Date**      | The specific date for each study session.                                                       |
| **Minutes**   | Total minutes studied on the given day.                                                         |

## Vision

This study log isn’t just about tracking hours or completing tasks—it’s a testament to my dedication to growth. With consistent effort, I aim to:
- Deepen my understanding of Data Science and related fields.
- Refine my skills over the years.
- Continuously improve my system to support long-term learning and productivity.

I hope this inspires others to create their own systems for tracking and celebrating progress.
